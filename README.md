# Tauri Nuxt App

## Installation

Run the following commands from the project root directory (i.e the same directory as this `README.md` file)

> [!TIP] tl;dr
> 0. Install pre-reqs
> 1. Build Python binary: `poetry run pyinstaller`
> 2. Install Node/Tauri stuff - `npm install`
> 3. Run in dev mode: `npm run dev`
> - OR-
> 4. Build installer: `npm run build`

### 0. Install pre-requisites
- Install Rust on your system - https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en
- Install Poetry - https://python-poetry.org/

### 1. Build Python executable for Tauri sidecar

**To generate the python sidecar executable, run the command (note, it takes a while):**

```
poetry run pyinstaller
```

We build the Python backend code (i.e. the uvicorn/fastapi api server) into a binary executable using [
`pyinstaller`](skellycam/utilities/build_pyinstaller_executable.py). This binary will be loaded and run as
a ['sidecar'](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/sidecar/) in the Tauri app.

The executable will be saved to the `skellycam/dist/` folder, with a 'target triple suffix' appended to the file name
based on the OS it was built on (see 'sidecar' link above for some terse details).

The path to this binary (minus the target triple and extension) must be specified in a few spots in the
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file (path relative to that file), as well in the `side_car_base_name` variable specified in
the `src-tauri/src/main.rs` file.



### 2. Install Node/Nuxt/Tauri stuff

```
npm install
```
> [!NOTE]
> The `postinstall` script in `package.json` cd's into the `skellycam-ui/` folder an runs `npm install` in there

### 3. Running the application in `dev` mode

To build and run the Tauri application in `dev`mode, run this command:
```
npm run dev
```

This should build the Rust backend, launch the nuxt/vue based frontend from `skellycam-ui` in a new window, and run the
python server sidecar. Check the terminal for relevant `localhost` urls

> [!TIP]
> If you are working on the python code and want to see changes without rebuilding the pyinstaller sidecar, simply run
`skellycam/__main__.py` after the Tauri app has aleady started. It will kill the `sidecar` program and take over serving
> responses on that port
> (I don't know if thats, like, the right way to do that, but it works for now Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

whee!

### 4. Building an installer

To produce installers and whatnot, run:

```
npm run build
```

> [!WARNING]
> This produces installers and stuff, which is cool, but the resulting application crashes immediately, which is less
> cool.
