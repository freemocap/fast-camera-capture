# Tauri Nuxt App

## Installation

Run the following commands from the project root directory (i.e the same directory as this `README.md` file)

> [!TIP] tl;dr
> 0. Install pre-reqs
> 1. Build Python binary: `poetry run pyinstaller`
> 2. Install Node/Tauri stuff - `npm install`
> 3. Run in dev mode: `npm run dev`
> - OR-
> 4. Build installer: `npm run build`

### 0. Install pre-requisites
- Install Rust on your system - https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en
- Install Poetry - https://python-poetry.org/

### 1. Build Python executable for Tauri sidecar

**To generate the python sidecar executable, run the command (note, it takes a while):**

```
poetry run pyinstaller
```

We build the Python backend code (i.e. the uvicorn/fastapi api server) into a binary executable using [
`pyinstaller`](skellycam/utilities/build_pyinstaller_executable.py). This binary will be loaded and run as
a ['sidecar'](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/building/sidecar/) in the Tauri app.

The executable will be saved to the `skellycam/dist/` folder, with a 'target triple suffix' appended to the file name
based on the OS it was built on (see 'sidecar' link above for some terse details).

The path to this binary (minus the target triple and extension) must be specified in a few spots in the
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` file (path relative to that file), as well in the `side_car_base_name` variable specified in
the `src-tauri/src/main.rs` file.



### 2. Install Node/Nuxt/Tauri stuff

```
npm install
```
> [!NOTE]
> The `postinstall` script in `package.json` cd's into the `skellycam-ui/` folder an runs `npm install` in there

### 3. Running the application in `dev` mode

To build and run the Tauri application in `dev`mode, run this command:
```
npm run dev
```

This should build the Rust backend, launch the nuxt/vue based frontend from `skellycam-ui` in a new window, and run the
python server sidecar. Check the terminal for relevant `localhost` urls

> [!TIP]
> If you are working on the python code and want to see changes without rebuilding the pyinstaller sidecar, simply run
`skellycam/__main__.py` after the Tauri app has aleady started. It will kill the `sidecar` program and take over serving
> responses on that port
> (I don't know if thats, like, the right way to do that, but it works for now Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

whee!

### 4. Building an installer

To produce installers and whatnot, run:

```
npm run build
```

> [!WARNING]
> This produces installers and stuff, which is cool, but the resulting application crashes immediately, which is less
> cool.



> **NOTE** - The SkellyCam package is the primary camera backend for the `freemocap` markeless motion capture software

## Installation and Usage

### 0. Open a terminal (ideally with a `python` virtual environment activate)

### 1. Install from Pip

Enter the command below and press 'Enter'

```bash
pip install skellycam
```

### 2. Launch SkellyCam GUI

Enter the command below and press 'Enter'

```bash
skellycam
```

### 3. Success! ðŸ’€ðŸ“¸âœ¨

Hopefully a bunch of text scrolled by and a GUI popped up!

If not, please [open an issue on the github repo](https://github.com/freemocap/skellycam/issues) and we'll try to help
you out :)

## Limitation (aka TO DO)  -

- Currently uses `opencv` to connect to cameras, so it won't recognize hardware that can't be connected
  with `cv2.VideoCapture` - Support for other camera hardware (e.g. FLIR) coming soon
- Camera streams are not synchronized at run time, but are saved and synchronized after the fact. This is time-consuming
  process that requres frames be saved in RAM until the recording is done. Both of these weaknesses have solutions in
  the works.

### New Python developers

1) Install Python 3.10
2) Create Virtual Environment
3) Install `skellycam`

#### To install Python 3.10

[Windows Python3 Installation Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-from-the-full-installer)

[MacOSX Python3 Installation Guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#step-1-download-the-official-installer)

[Linux Python3 Installation Guide](https://computingforgeeks.com/how-to-install-python-on-ubuntu-linux-system/)

### How to use

#### RECOMMENDED - Use the GUI!

Launch the GUI by running `skellycam` in a terminal.

This is currently the most tested method for interacting with the cameras.

#### Example 1 - Connecting to a single Camera and showing the video feed

[Example 1 Python Fle](skellycam/experiments/examples/example1_single_camera_connection.py)

In this example, we connect a camera at index 0. Calling `show` allows us to view the cameras frames allowing us
to see video.

> NOTE - Work in progress, no clean way to kill this window yet

```python
from skellycam.core.cameras.camera.config.camera_config import CameraConfig
, Camera

if __name__ == "__main__":
  cam1 = Camera(CameraConfig(cam_id=0))
  cam1.connect()
  cam1.show()
```

#### Example 2 - Connect to all available cameras and record synchronized videos

> NOTE - Experimental and under development, might be unstable

[Example 2 Python Fle](skellycam/experiments/examples/example1_single_camera_connection.py)

```python
from skellycam.experiments import MultiCameraVideoRecorder

if __name__ == "__main__":
    synchronized_video_recorder = MultiCameraVideoRecorder()
    synchronized_video_recorder.run()

```
